- but comes as a 2 pack, only need one 1 splitter per build, no superfluous extension cables

Or just do the fan wiring directly from raw wires and JST connectors;
would also cut down on internal wiring bulk by using tiny JST ZH connectors.

Improve mesh wall section integration:
- thicken the wall so that it has more grip surface
- maybe make the dovetails a little wider and deeper
- taper the dovetails so that they resist coming apart around curves
