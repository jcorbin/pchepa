# v1.0.1

- switched to an even number of wrap wall sections, to avoid placing a join seam at the point of most strain
- made the power channel plug fit tighter, and also made its removal notch larger to ease removal with pliers
- improved base plate power socket geometry where it comes near to the mesh wall slot
- added a clip/socket fit test, and used it to make it tune socket size, allowing much easier assembly
- dropped unused fan wire channel option from the cover plate
- added textual guide and parts list based on prototype build
- expanded project level documentation including design notes, slicer setting recommendations, etc
- cleaned up and documented customizable parameters

Errata:
- not yet happy with the mesh wall integrity under bend/strain, experimenting with different joinery for next
- the plate geometry gets is a little wonky where the half-circle becomes a straight edge, will likely remake that shape slightly in a next version

# v1.0.0

- first dual filter prototype version completed
