# Miscellaneous 3D Print Models

This repository is my dumping ground for arbitrary models that don't warrent breaking out into their own separate repositories.

# Setup

These models are implemented as [OpenSCAD][openscad] scripts using the [BOSL2][bosl2] library.

After cloning this repository, run `git submoule update --init` to ensure the needed copy of BOSL2 is setup.
