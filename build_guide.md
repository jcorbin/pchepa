# Build v1.1

There are primarily 2 variants:
1. a stationary variant that merely has a USB-C port in its base
2. a portable variant that integrates a USB-C battery bank into a thicker base

There are published slicer projects (3mf files) on MakerWorld, or STL filesets on Thangs:
- Duo v1.0.1: [3MF Layouts][duo_makerworld] or [STL Models][duo_thangs]

## Suggested Tools

- a 3d printer with enough build volume ( 250mm x 250mm in the XY is the main going concern )
- a soldering iron with heatset insert tips
- wire stripper
- side snips for trimming wire ends and such
- heatgun to help bend wall segments
- a spudger like <https://www.printables.com/model/656983> helps at many points

## Material Cost Estimates

Assuming filament cost of $14.99/kg:
1. stationary costs about $91.61
2. portable costs about $135.36

Breakdown:
- 3d printed parts:
  1. stationary needs 930g of filament and around 27 hours of print time over 13 prints
  2. portable needs 1.23kg of filament and around 35 hours of print time over 13 prints
- commodity parts:
  - fans and filters cost around $58
  - mechanical hardware and electronics cost around $20 per unit
    (pwm controller, usb pd trigger, various wires, metric bolts and heatset inserts)
  - portable costs another $39.31 for a usb battery bank, patch cable, and carrying strap

NOTE: due to most electronic and mechanical parts coming in kits/packs,
you'll likely spend more up front, and then have a lot of spare parts on hand.

## Guide

If you're using a reliable printer and all the same BOM parts as cited above, smaller test prints shouldn't be necessary.

However if you're changing out parts, customizing things, or doubt your printer's accuracy there are several ancillary test print models that may be printed first.

All parts are designed to be printed without auto-generated supports; any parts that do require support,
come with breakaway support structures builtin (e.g. every clip socket, and the battery bank tunnel).

All of the recommended slicer settings, build plate layouts, and printer settings for a Bambu printer can be downloaded from [MakerWorld][duo_makerworld].

General suggested slicer settings:
- walls: 3 loops/perimeters
- top/bottom: 3 layers
- sparse infill: 7% tri-hexagon

Most parts come in an A (left) and B (right) side version; the A side is primary, mounting the control module and power modules.

### 1. Print Cover A

Also print several the joiner clips along with each cover plate, placing them inside the filter ring of the cover plate.
The stationary variant needs 8 clips total, while the portable variant needs 12 (4 more).

Once printed add 4 heatset inserts.

### 2. Print Fan Grill A

Print the A side grill box along with its PWM potentiometer knob.

Prepare the PWM pcb by replacing any power leads it came w with a pair JST header wires.

Install the PWM pcb through the hole in the grill front-right face.

Plug the Y-splitter cable into the PWM pcb's header; it should comfortably clear/pass through the front hemi-octagonal cover port.

Mount the grill/fan/cover with 4 M3x35 bolts. The fan's wire should pass through the back hemi-octagonal cover port.

NOTE: you can manage most of the fan's wire length by orienting the fan to wrap its wire around itself;
i.e. place the corner where the fan wire exits farthest away from the cover/grill center.

The Y-splitter cable and fan lead can then connect below the cover plate ( what will eventually be interstitial space between both filter cylinders ).

NOTE: if you have a small zip tie on hand, add one to secure the JST power leads to the Y-splitter cable close to the PWM controller;
this can help relieve any strain that may otherwise rip a wire off the PWM pcb.

### 3. Print Base A

Print the A side of whichever base variant you want ( use the thicker "with battery tunnel" one for a portable filter ).
Also print the corresponding channel plug part.

NOTE: if you want the QR code to read, you'll need to do a multi-color print; the easiest way to do this is to import both the `base` STL and corresponding `base_label` STL as simultaneous parts of one assembly.

Prepare the USB-C PD trigger by soldering on a pair of JST header wires of the **opposite gender** as used for the PWM pcb in step 2.

Install the pd trigger into the base port cavity.
Use a small spudger or other non-metal poke/pry tool to press the module forward once it has bottomed out inside the channel.

Insert the channel plug behind the pd trigger.
The pd trigger should slide forward far enough that the plug can fully seat behind it,
preventing the pd trigger from moving when plug/unplugged.

### 4. (optional) Test!

At this point you should have half of a working filter, assemble all of the A side components around one HEPA filter cylinder.

The fit for the HEPA filter's lip should require flexing its plastic ring to insert/remove;
this is another point where a spudger can help, but you should also be able to make it work simply by manual flexing.

### 5. Print Joiner Clips

You'll need 8-12 joiner clips ( 8 for the stationary version, 4 more for the thicker portable battery base ).

As a reminder, these work best when sliced as "pure walls": 0 top/bottom layers, and enough wall perimeters so that they're all wall, no infill.

### 6. (optional) Print 3 Wall Sections

You may choose to printout 3 wall sections to complete your half-build first, or you may move on to B-side completion before building the wall.

See step 8 below for notes on wall printing, bending, and installation.

### 7. Print and Assemble B Side

Print the B side of the cover, grill, and base plates.

Assemble the cover/fan/grill similarly to step 2 above, but sans PWM controller.

Join the cover/base plates together using the rabbit clips from step 5.

### 8. Print Wall Sections

These rely on a slicer trick: print them with 0 top/bottom layers, and a high level of sparse infill.
You may choose any infill pattern and density that you like the look of.
A good amount seems to be 60% tri-hexagon with a 90Â° direction.

You'll need 6 wall sections in total; 3 of them should cover one half of the filter, with a seam aligned with the base/cover/grill seam.

#### (optional) Pre-Bend Wall Bender and Heatgun

If you can print a higher temperature plastic like ABS or PETG,
and if you've got a heatgun (or maybe a hair dryer in a pinch),
then consider printing out the optional wall bender model.
The wall bender print takes about 184g of filament and 4 hours ( on my bambu machine ) for reference.

To use the wall bender, simply use a pair of cover/base plates snapped onto one filter, then place wall bender around filter.
The assembled unit can then sit curved end up.

New unbent wall sections can then be inserted by sliding them into the end slot channels.
Once in place use a heatgun to soften wall sections, pressing them into the wall bender underneath.

#### Wall Section Installation

Fully assemble the filter with its HEPA filter cylinders; don't forget to connect the JST power connectors.

To install each wall section, first insert it into the base channel, then flex the wall panel to get the top edge into the cover channel.

With a fresh unbent wall panel, do this along the flat front/back edge and then slide the section into place.

After the panels are in place, a heatgun may be used to help them accept their new shape.
